# Custom Implementations

Within this repository is an assortment of custom implementations of existing, popular machine learning and deep learning algorithms and models.

Given the balance required between creating new projects with existing implementations and creating these custom implementations, this will repository will grow gradually over time.

## Contents

So far, the models that have been implemented *and tested* are: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in /kolmogorov_arnold_network. This architecture was inspired by [this 2024 research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756) and has been proposed as a potential substitute for Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

In progress is the Transformer architecture described in the 2017 research paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Refer to /transformer.

## What's To Come

DL Models to be implemented include Transformers, Feedforward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRUs).

ML Models/Algorithms to be implemented include: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost.
